# DASH GPA & CGPA Calculator
A sleek, dynamic React + Vite application that lets you manage semesters, add courses, track grades, and calculate both GPA per semester and CGPA overall â€” all in one place.
Data is saved locally so your progress stays even after refreshing.

This is my first official GitHub contribution â€” and I couldnâ€™t be more excited!

# What I Learned & Applied

This project was a crash course in turning raw logic into an actual working product.

Some highlights:

--Data Structures:--

Used arrays of objects to represent semesters and courses.

Applied .map(), .filter(), and .reduce() for clean data transformations.

--State Management in React:--

Managed deeply nested state updates without mutating original data.

Lifted state up to share data between components.

--React Hooks:--

useState for reactive UI updates.

useEffect for syncing state with Local Storage and performing calculations.

--Persistent Storage:--

Integrated Local Storage so all course/semester data survives refreshes.

# Note
This project means a lot â€” itâ€™s my first official React.js GitHub push and proof that I can take an idea, break it down into steps, and make it real.
